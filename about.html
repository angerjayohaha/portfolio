    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
  I'm a BSIT student who dreams of becoming a cybersecurity expert and game developer. I have a strong interest in technology and how it works. Cybersecurity makes me curious because I want to protect systems from hackers and threats. I believe it's important to keep peopleâ€™s data safe online. On the other hand, I also love games and how they are made. Game development lets me use my creativity and problem-solving skills. I want to create games that are fun, exciting, and meaningful. Even though I'm still learning, I enjoy exploring both fields. I always try to improve my skills and learn new things. In the future, I hope to build secure systems and develop games that people will love.
